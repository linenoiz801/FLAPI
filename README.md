# FLAPI

This project will be to build an API to build a database of lore in the Fallout universe. This 
will be used by anyone interested in exploring the history of the game in more detail. The Vault 
Dwellers team are all big fans of the Fallout franchise and believe a publicly accessible database 
will be of great benefit to all mankind and a Super Mutant or two.
